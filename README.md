# Landing Page Project

This project consists of a main body of chapter sections and a top navigation menu. You can see which item in the navigation menu is active, by hovering over the item in the menu, because of how the item changes colors. 

Clicking on any of the active menu items will take you to the beginning of that chapter. Scrolling through the chapters can be done independent of the navigation bar or selection of active menu items. 

I realized I could refactor the JavaScript for this project into tighter code, but I chose to separate it into longer sections for clarity and debugging purposes.
